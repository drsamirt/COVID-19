# COVID-19
Analysis of COVID-19 cases after initial six months of Pandemic outbreak
This project was part of the course that I had taken up during summer semester. 
The objective was to parse live XML data from the website and do trend analysis of various continents/countries across the globe.
Creating graphs using ggplot2, helped to analyse not only progression of number of cases in the globe,
but various other parameters like also mortality rate, death to case ratio, cases progresssion per country.
We also covered comparison of these parameters between countries with small population and large population.
I focused on countries of european continent that was crippled due to COVID-19 outbreak.
